# Looking for Work

I was laid off last week, that sucked. But, I got so much response to [tweeting about it](https://twitter.com/younata/status/1083957916040753152) that I’m not at all worried about this. I’ve applied to and talked to so many people at so many companies that I’m sure I’ll be fine. I actually have to maintain a spreadsheet of companies I’ve talked to and my current state with them.

# Electric Plane

I wasn’t going to start building this anytime soon anyway, due to a lack of workspace. But this might be put off even further than I originally desired because of my current unemployment. On the other hand, I currently have enough free time to be able to work on some of the design aspects of this plane (the two outstanding problems I need to solve before I feel confident in starting construction are the motor controllers and charging).

# Pivotal Holiday Party

I spent this past weekend in the bay area. For the entire purpose of going to my former company’s holiday party. It was super great to see all my friends from there, as well as all the new faces since I left a year and a half ago. I still consider Pivotal SF a home, and maybe I’ll go back after I’m able to leave LA.

# Lunar Eclipse Tonight

There’s a full lunar eclipse tonight! [Carrot Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?mt=8) (weather underground/the weather channel as source) is telling me it’ll be mostly cloudy tonight, though. But, maybe I’ll be able to get SOME photographs of it from the roof of my apartment’s parking garage.

It managed to clear out by the time of the eclipse, and I managed to get some [awesome photographs](https://twitter.com/younata/status/1087205728123645952) of it. Going to spend time tomorrow making a timelapse of the eclipse, which’ll be super cool.

Relatedly, I need to figure out how to use my equatorial mount. I was out there for 2 hours or so, and moving the scope for each photograph sucked.
