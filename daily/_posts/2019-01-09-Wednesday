# Still Ill

Worked from home today. Wasn’t feeling well enough to go to work, but was able to work at a reduced capacity today. That’s fine. Got a little done today, too. Even was able to “participate” in a meeting (which really only showed how bad we are at remote meetings). Overall, it was fine. Maybe I’ll get well enough tonight to feel up to going in to... yeah, no. I’m going to stay home tomorrow, just in case.

# Flying

I finally got around to scheduling my next flight lesson. I wanted to take a break to get my finances into a healthier position before I started in the new year. Also, I didn’t want to fly when it’s cold. This lesson should by one of the last ones I do before soloing, or it’ll be my first solo flight. I’ll find out when it happens.

# Provenance

I installed [Provenance](https://provenance-emu.com) on my ipad yesterday, and today I spent some of my free time playing Super Mario 64. I never played the original on the N64 - in fact, there’s a lot of great games from that era that I didn’t get the chance to play. I’m not going to go binge those games anyway. Not the least because the controller I have isn’t the best. I wish I could use an xbox controller (I probably could with an emulator running on osx). But this is good enough.
