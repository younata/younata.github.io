Happy New Year.

This is a thing I do at work - have an internal log that I update every day with what I did and how I did it. I like that, and decided to put a part of my blog as that, but still separate from the single-subject articles.

Home:

- Made Nicole a paper-towel based coffee filter, because weâ€™re out of legitimate coffee filters.
- Played Pandemic with Nicole. ðŸ¥°
	- We won, because we played on easy.
	- We also didnâ€™t read the rules correctly, and thought we had to not only cure the diseases, but also eradicate them. So, we eradicated 3 of them, and ran out of player cards when there was only 1 cube left of the fourth disease. We were really sad until we reread the rules and saw that we only had to cure all the diseases, not eradicate them.
- Made Pasta for dinner.
    - Angel Hair pasta
    - Tomato sauce (store-bought ðŸ˜Ÿ)
    - Sausage (ðŸ˜±)


Short-Term Goals:

- âœ… Be able to log in to my inoreader client from my [rss reader](https://github.com/younata/tethys).
	- This is just logging in, not doing anything with the returned credentials - not even saving them.
- âœ… Go through and update my financial records.
	- I use [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org), so this was copying the transactions from my bank accounts/credit cards and putting them in my ledger.txt file.
	- I use [ledger-autosync](https://gitlab.com/egh/ledger-autosync) to copy transactions, so this work was entirely naming the accounts that each transaction used.
	- As expected for a millenial, the vast majority of my expenses go towards rent.
- Update blog so that this can actually be separate from the main articles
    - Kinda, laid the groundwork for this.
