I'm Rachel, an OSX, iOS, and Robotics developer. I build little utilities for iOS that scratch my itches, and I build robots or other hardware projects whenever those itches need to get scratch.

I built [rNews](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rnews/id934611158?ls=1&mt=8), an RSS reader for iOS. I've also been in the process of building an autonomous RC car. Currently, my free time has been split between those two and my home automation projects.
